I ve figured out that there are 6 type of calculating with percentage which are :

1. Basic part, whole, miltiplying by 100
2  Aggregation
3. With conditions
4. Percentage change
5. Cumulative %
6. Weighted %


So at the moment I am sharpening my knowledge on all of these calculations starting the the basics one first. 

tomorrow I need to analyze the dataset from teh the metabease


26.05.2025

Today I coded on the project of the airline and only the 7th and 8th task is left to finish it. I am certain by tomorrow I will get it done.

27.05.25


Today I am working on the codecademy taks 7 and 8 to complete it today. It takes too much time to upload and work there. From now on I am 
thinking where I dy any task I fist complete it in jupyter notebook and at codecademy one by one. In order to upload also my work in 
codecademy.

AI feedback on my project:

1. Ensure that all tasks are completed as per the project requirements. For instance, Task 6 could include more analysis on how the 
number of passengers changes with flight length, rather than just visualizing it. 

(meaining : I need to digg deeper to get more insights about the  issue)


2. Consider using functions to encapsulate repetitive code blocks, such as plotting functions. This will make your code more modular
and easier to maintain.

example: 

def plot_histogram(data, title, xlabel, ylabel):
    sns.histplot(data)
    plt.title(title)
    plt.xlabel(xlabel)
    plt.ylabel(ylabel)
    plt.show()
    plt.clf()

plot_histogram(flight.coach_price, "1 : Boxplot of Coach Price", "Price", "Frequency")

Today I had an hour of studying . 


29.05

Today I finished my EDA analysis with codecademy. Got my certificate. 



8.06. 

Today I have a lot of problem with github I spent a hour try to fix my github stil couldnt do it. So but anyway in the morning I spent an hour
to do a deep work. That is already a good sign that I am doing. 

9.06.

    Today I am having 2h of deep work to intentionally  work on my project. I worked enough and I am seeing progress. Need to work more
and more. 

27.06

Today I am coming back to my coding in python doing EDA Analysis. So continuing my job. It seems and feels so difficult to me. I dont know
but anyway I am doing it. Lets suffer I am not enjoying it at all. But anyway, I dont have any other choice but to code to earn more and 
make a better life. I better start to enjoying it more than complain about it because I dont have any other choice but to learn more. 




22.07.25

Today is 22 of July meaning I skipped 27 day of the project and I am really embarassed that I escaped myself. 
So today I am going to continue with the Airbnb project. 

24. 07

I skipped one day but it was great day did 2h and 20minutes of deep work and I saw some progress . I need to do more and more 
that's really important.


25.07

Today is my day off but I am commited to dedicate 6h of work in my project. I am starting it. Lets go!

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

listings_lisbon.loc[:,'availability_range'] = pd.cut(
    listings_lisbon['availability_365'], 
    bins=[-1,0,180, 364, 365],
    labels = ['Unavailable', 'Seasonal', 'Mostly Available', 'Always Available']
)

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

My goal is at the moment to understand this code. 

So to my knowledge we are accessing the dataframe listings_lisbon here using the (,loc) indexer to create a new column 
called availability_range and choosing the all rows . By the pd.cut() function of the pandas library to categorize the availablity_365
column. 


26.07

Today is another day I am working  on my project. I am stil doing an "univariate analysis" of the availability_265 column meaning. Analyzing
the yearly availibilty of the column. Today in the morning I finished the visualization part. At the same time I am curious abou the 
technical part of the solution. I am trying to understand every bits of the code what it does for instance.

28.07 

For some reason I am skipping one day . I don't know why is this the case. Anyway lets get start to work. Now we are 
ready to put 3h of work into todays agenda. We are moving slowly but intentionally. Lets go.

30. 07

Yesterday I did some work which was 4h and did not register in Github. Today I am moving to
the 3rd hours of data woork. Now I am trying to finish the last part of numerical univariate 
analysis with the airbnb data. 

31.
    Yesterday I finished the univariate analysis with the numerical values so now this 3hours I am going to dedicate to the 
categorical variables of doing inivariate analysis. 

1.08.25

Finally I finished the Univariate Analysis with the Airbnb dataset congratulations. On the 1st phase Need to do more. I spent 3h doing that.
1h Rest and then continue.
